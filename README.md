Hello

I have completed both the assignments and pushed them here.

For both the assignments I have written the code for API call, streamlit UI as well as a sample API call.

Prerequisites - 
Python 3.x installed on your system
Git installed on your system
An OpenAI API key (set it as an environment variable named OPENAI_API_KEY)

Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/jeevanv123/yarnit.git

cd yarnit

pip install -r requirements.txt

To run the API - 
python API_marketing.py
python API_website.py

Sample API call input please look into files sample_marketing.py and sample_website_chat.py

Streamlit Web Interface - 
streamlit run marketing_app.py
website_chat_app.py
